# Aero-Plane-Design-Using-SketchUp

## Introduction
This project showcases the design and creation of an aeroplane model using SketchUp software and 3D printing technology. SketchUp's intuitive design tools were used to create an aeroplane that balances aerodynamics and structural integrity. After refining the digital model, it was 3D printed to bring the concept to life.
The result is a detailed aeroplane model that highlights the power of 3D design and additive manufacturing. This project demonstrates the potential for rapid prototyping and custom engineering, underscoring the transformative role of technology in aeronautics and design.
